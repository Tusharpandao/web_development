                <div id="box1_img"></div>
                <div class="box1_con">Delhi,[a] officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and
                    a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Straddling the Yamuna river,
                    primarily its western or right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the
                    east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. The NCT covers an area of 1,484
                    square kilometres (573 sq mi).[5] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was
                    over 11 million,[14][15] while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[16] Delhi's urban
                    agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in an
                    area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28 million,
                    making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after
                    Tokyo).[17]

                    The topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the
                    literary description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however,
                    excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. From the early 13th
                    century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of two major empires, the Delhi sultanate
                    and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts of South Asia. All three UNESCO World Heritage
                    Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong to this period. Delhi
                    was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau
                    are prominently associated with it. The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic
                    development that gave rise to the literature of the Urdu language and then of Modern Standard Hindi.
                    Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib. Delhi was a major centre of the
                    Indian Rebellion of 1857. In 1911, New Delhi, a southern region within Delhi, became the capital of
                    the British Indian Empire. During the Partition of India in 1947, Delhi was transformed from a
                    Mughal city to a Punjabi one, losing two-thirds of its Muslim residents, in part due to the pressure
                    brought to bear by arriving Hindu and Sikh refugees from western Punjab.[18] After independence in
                    1947, New Delhi continued as the capital of the Dominion of India, and after 1950 of the Republic of
                    India.</div>

                <h1 class="fodh">Mumbai</h1>
                <div id="box2_img"></div>
                <div class="box1_con">Mumbai (English: /mʊmˈbaɪ/ (listen), Marathi: [ˈmumbəi]; also known as Bombay
                    /bɒmˈbeɪ/— the official name until 1995) is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra.
                    Mumbai is the de facto financial centre and the most populous city of India with an estimated city
                    proper population of 12.5 million (1.25 crore).[17] Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan
                    Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23 million
                    (2.3 crore) living under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.[18] Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast
                    on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world
                    city.[19][20]

                    The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were earlier home to communities of Marathi
                    language-speaking Koli people.[21][22][23] For centuries, the seven islands of Bombay were under the
                    control of successive indigenous rulers before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire, and
                    subsequently to the East India Company in 1661, through the dowry of Catherine Braganza when she was
                    married off to Charles II of England.[24] During the mid-18th century, Mumbai was reshaped by the
                    Hornby Vellard project,[25] which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from
                    the sea.[26] Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed
                    in 1845, transformed Mumbai into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Mumbai in the 19th century was
                    characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a
                    strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was
                    incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of
                    Maharashtra was created with Mumbai as the capital.[27]

                    Mumbai is the financial, commercial,[28] and the entertainment capital of India. It is also one of
                    the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow,[29] generating 6.16% of
                    India's GDP,[30] and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai
                    Port Trust, Dharamtar Port and JNPT),[31] and 70% of capital transactions to India's
                    economy.[32][33] The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of
                    numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of India's premier
                    scientific and nuclear institutes. The city is also home to Bollywood and Marathi cinema industries.
                    Mumbai's business opportunities attract migrants from all over India</div>

                <h1 class="fodh">Hyderabad</h1>
                <div id="box3_img"></div>
                <div class="box1_con">Hyderabad (/ˈhaɪdərəbæd/ (listen) HY-dər-ə-bad;[5] Telugu: [ˈɦaɪ̯daraːbaːd], Urdu:
                    [ˈɦɛːdəɾaːbaːd]) is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana. It occupies 650
                    km2 (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of
                    Southern India. With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly
                    terrain around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in
                    the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 Census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most
                    populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a
                    population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous
                    metropolitan area in India. With an output of US$74 billion, Hyderabad has the fifth-largest urban
                    economy in India.

                    The Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital
                    beyond the fortified Golconda. In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. In 1724, Asaf Jah I,
                    the Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also known as the
                    Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahi's from 1769 to 1948. As capital of
                    the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian
                    independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital
                    of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of
                    1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was
                    split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states with
                    a transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024. Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati
                    Nilayam, the winter office of the president of India.

                    Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise
                    the city. By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had declined in the Deccan, and the
                    Nizam's patronage attracted men of letters from various parts of the world. A distinctive culture
                    arose from the amalgamation of local and migrated artisans, with Painting, handicraft, jewellery,
                    literature, dialect and clothing are prominent still today. Through its cuisine, the city is listed
                    as a creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO. The Telugu film industry based in the city was the
                    country's second-largest producer of motion pictures as of 2012.</div>

                <div id="box4_img"></div>
                <div class="box1_con">The city is coterminous with Chennai district, which together with the adjoining
                    suburbs constitutes the Chennai Metropolitan Area,[note 1] the 36th-largest urban area in the world
                    by population[28] and one of the largest metropolitan economies of India. As the traditional and de
                    facto gateway of South India,[1][2][3][4] Chennai is among the most-visited Indian cities by
                    foreigners. It was ranked the 43rd most-visited city in the world in 2015 and 36th in 2019.[29][30]
                    The Quality of Living Survey rates it as India's safest city.[31] Chennai attracts 45 percent of
                    health tourists visiting India, and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists.[32] As such, it is
                    termed "India's health capital".[33][34] Chennai has the fifth-largest urban economy,[35] and had
                    the third-largest expatriate population in India.[36][37]

                    Ranked as a beta-level city in the Global Cities Index,[38] Chennai was dubbed India's best city by
                    India Today in 2014.[39][40] It was named the "hottest" city (city worth visiting and worth living
                    in for long term) by the BBC in 2015, citing its amalgam of both modern and traditional values.[41]
                    It was the only South Asian city to feature on National Geographic's "Top 10 food cities" in
                    2015,[42] and ranked ninth on Lonely Planet's best cosmopolitan cities of the world.[43] In October
                    2017, Chennai was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) list for its rich musical
                    tradition.[44] Chennai hosts more than one-third of India's automobile industry, and is a major film
                    production center, home to the Tamil film industry.</div>

                <h1 class="fodh">Agra</h1>
                <div id="box5_img"></div>
                <div class="box1_con">Agra (/ˈɑːɡrə/, Hindustani: [ˈaːgraː] (listen)) is a city on the banks of the
                    Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, about 230 kilometres (140 mi) south-east of the
                    national capital Delhi and 330 km west of the state capital Lucknow. With a population of roughly
                    1.6 million, Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and twenty-third most populous
                    city in India.[11]

                    Agra's notable historical period began during Sikandar Lodi's reign, but the golden age of the city
                    began with the Mughals. Agra was the foremost city of the Indian subcontinent and the capital of the
                    Mughal Empire under Mughal emperors Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Under Mughal
                    rule, Agra became a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion, and saw the construction of
                    the Agra Fort, Sikandra and Agra's most prized monument, the Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan as a
                    mausoleum for his favourite empress. With the decline of the Mughal empire in the late 18th century,
                    the city fell successively first to Marathas and later to the East India Company. After
                    Independence, Agra has developed into an industrial town, with a booming tourism industry, along
                    with footwear, leather and other manufacturing. The Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort are UNESCO World
                    Heritage Sites. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season, and is
                    famous for its Mughlai cuisine. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with
                    Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with
                    Lucknow and Varanasi.</div>
